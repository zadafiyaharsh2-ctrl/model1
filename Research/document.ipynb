Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary defines \\nresearch as \"studious inquiry or examination; esp: investigation or experimentation \\naimed at the discovery and interpretation of facts, revision of accepted theories or \\nlaws in the light of new facts, or practical application of such new or revised \\ntheories or laws\". Some people consider research as a movement, a movement \\nfrom the known to the unknown.\\nIt is actually a voyage of discovery. We all possess the vital instinct of \\ninquisitiveness for, when the unknown confronts us, we wonder and our \\ninquisitiveness makes us probe and attain full and fuller understanding of the \\nunknown. This inquisitiveness is the mother of all knowledge and the method, \\nwhich man employs for obtaining the knowledge of whatever the unknown, can be \\ntermed as research.\\nResearch is an academic activity and as such the term should be used in a technical \\nsense. According to Clifford Woody research comprises defining and redefining \\nproblems, formulating hypothesis or suggested solutions; collecting, organizing \\nand evaluating data; making deductions and reaching conclusions; and at last \\ncarefully testing the conclusions to determine whether they fit the formulating \\nhypothesis. D. Steiner and M. Stephenson in the Encyclopedia of Social Sciences \\ndefine research as “the manipulation of things, concepts or symbols for the purpose \\nof generalizing to extend, correct or verify knowledge, whether that knowledge \\naids in construction of theory or in the practice of an art.”\\nResearch is, thus, an original contribution to the existing stock of knowledge \\nmaking for its advancement. It is the pursuit of truth with the help of study, \\nobservation, comparison and experiment. In short, the search for knowledge \\nthrough objective and systematic method of finding solution to a problem is \\nresearch. The systematic approach concerning generalization and the formulation \\nof a theory is also research. As such the term ‘research’ refers to the systematic \\nmethod consisting of enunciating the problem, formulating a hypothesis, collecting'),\n",

Research methods may be understood as all \\nthose methods/ techniques that are used for conduction of research. Research \\nmethods or techniques*, thus, refer to the methods the researchers use in \\nperforming research operations. In other words, all those methods which are used \\nby the researcher during the course of studying his research problem are termed as \\nresearch methods. Since the object of research, particularly the applied research, it \\nto arrive at a solution for a given problem, the available data and the unknown \\naspects of the problem have to be related to each other to make a solution possible. \\nKeeping this in view, research methods can be put into the following three groups:\\n1. In the first group we include those methods which are concerned with the \\ncollection of data. These methods will be used where the data already \\navailable are not sufficient to arrive at the required solution;\\n2.

In it we study the various steps that are generally \\nadopted by a researcher in studying his research problem along with the logic \\nbehind them.\\nIt is necessary for the researcher to know not only the research methods/techniques \\nbut also the methodology. Researchers not only need to know how to develop \\ncertain indices or tests, how to calculate the mean, the mode, the median or the \\nstandard deviation or chi-square, how to apply particular research techniques, but \\nthey also need to know which of these methods or techniques, are relevant and \\nwhich are not, and what would they mean and indicate and why.\\nResearchers also need to understand the assumptions underlying various \\ntechniques and they need to know the criteria by which they can decide that certain \\ntechniques and procedures will be applicable to certain problems and others will \\nnot. All this means that it is necessary for the researcher to design his methodology \\nfor his problem as the same may differ from problem to problem. For example, an \\narchitect, who designs a building, has to consciously evaluate the basis of his \\ndecisions, i.e., he has to evaluate why and on what basis he selects particular size, \\nnumber and location of doors, windows and ventilators,uses particular materials \\nand not others and the like.\\nSimilarly, in research the scientist has to expose the research decisions to \\nevaluation before they are implemented. He has to specify very clearly and \\nprecisely what decisions he selects and why he selects them so that they can be \\nevaluated by others also.

A complete enumeration of all the \\nitems in the ‘population’ is known as a census inquiry. It can be presumed that in \\nsuch an inquiry when all the items are covered no element of chance is left and \\nhighest accuracy is obtained. But in practice this may not be true.\\nEven the slightest element of bias in such an inquiry will get larger and larger as \\nthe number of observations increases. Moreover, there is no way of checking the \\nelement of bias or its extent except through is survey or use of sample checks. \\nBesides, this type of inquiry involves a great deal of time, money and energy. Not \\nonly this, census inquiry is not possible in practice under many circumstances. For \\ninstance, blood testing is done only on sample basis. Hence, quite often we select \\nonly a few items from the universe for our study purposes. The items so selected \\nconstitute what is technically called sample.\\nThe researcher must decide the way of selecting a sample or what is popularly \\nknown as the sample design. In other words, a sample design is a definite plan \\ndetermined before any data are actually collected for obtaining a sample from a \\ngiven population. Thus, the plan to select 12 of a city’s 200 drugstores in a certain \\nway constitutes a sample design. Samples can be either probability samples or non-\\nprobability samples.\\nWith probability samples each element has a known probability of being included \\nin the sample but the non-probability samples do not allow the researcher to \\ndetermine this probability. Probability samples are those based on simple random \\nsampling, systematic sampling, stratified sampling, cluster/area sampling whereas \\nnon-probability samples are those based on convenience sampling, judgment \\nsampling and quota sampling techniques. A brief mention of the important sample \\ndesigns is as follows:\\na.Deliberate sampling: Deliberate sampling is also known as purposive or non-\\nprobability sampling. This sampling method involves purposive or deliberate \\nselection of particular units of the universe for constituting a sample which \\nrepresents the universe. When population elements are selected for inclusion in the \\nsample based on the ease of access, it can be called convenience sampling. If a \\nresearcher wishes to secure data from, say, gasoline buyers, he may select a fixed \\nnumber of petrol stations and may conduct interviews at these stations. This would'),\n",

At times such a \\nprocedure may give very biased results particularly when the population is not \\nhomogeneous. On the other hand, in judgment sampling the researcher’s judgment \\nused for selecting items which he considers as representative of the population. For \\nexample, a judgment sample of college students might be taken to secure reactions \\nto a new method of teaching. Judgment sampling is used quite frequently in \\nqualitative research where the desire happens to be to develop hypotheses rather \\nthan to generalize to larger populations.\\nb.Simple random sampling: This type of sampling is also known as chance \\nsampling or probability sampling where each and every item in the population has \\nan equal chance of inclusion in the sample and each one of the possible samples, in \\ncase of finite universe, has the same probability of being selected. For example, if \\nwe have to select a sample of 300items from a universe of 15,000 items, then we \\ncan put the names or numbers of all the15,000 items on slips of paper and conduct \\na lottery. Using the random number tables is another method of random sampling. \\nTo select the sample, each item is assigned a number from 1 to 15,000. Then, 300 \\nfive digits random numbers are selected from the table. To do this we select some \\nrandom starting point and then a systematic pattern is used in proceeding through \\nthe table. We might start in the 4th row, second column and proceed down the \\ncolumn to the bottom of the table and then move to the top of the next column to \\nthe right. When a number exceeds the limit of the numbers in the frame, in our \\ncase over 15,000, it is simply passed over and the next number selected that does \\nfall within the relevant range. Since the numbers were placed in the table in a \\ncompletely random fashion, the resulting sample is random. This procedure gives \\neach item an equal probability of being selected. In case of infinite population, the \\nselection of each item in a random sample is controlled by the same probability \\nand that successive selections are independent of one another.\\nc.Systematic sampling: In some instances the most practical way of sampling is to \\nselect every 15th name on a list, every 10th house on one side of a street and so on. \\nSampling of this type is known as systematic sampling. An element of randomness \\nis usually introduced into this kind of sampling by using random numbers to pick \\nup the unit with which to start. This procedure is useful when sampling frame is \\navailable in the form of a list. In such design the selection process starts by picking'),\n",

In this technique, the population is stratified \\ninto a number of non-overlapping subpopulations or strata and sample items are \\nselected from each stratum. If the items selected from each stratum is based on \\nsimple random sampling the entire procedure, first stratification and then simple \\nrandom sampling, is known as stratified random sampling.\\ne.Quota sampling: In stratified sampling the cost of taking random samples from \\nindividual strata is often so expensive that interviewers are simply given quota to \\nbe filled from different strata, the actual selection of items for sample being left to \\nthe interviewer judgment. This is called quota sampling. The size of the quota for \\neach stratum is generally proportionate to the size of that stratum in the population. \\nQuota sampling is thus an important form of non-probability sampling. Quota \\nsamples generally happen to be judgment samples rather than random samples.\\nf. Cluster sampling and area sampling: Cluster sampling involves grouping the \\npopulation and then selecting the groups or the clusters rather than individual \\nelements for inclusion in the sample. Suppose some departmental store wishes to \\nsample its credit card holders. It has issued its cards to 15,000 customers. The \\nsample size is to be kept say 450. For cluster sampling this list of 15,000 card \\nholders could be formed into 100 clusters of 150 cardholders each. Three clusters \\nmight then be selected for the sample randomly. The sample size must often be \\nlarger than the simple random sample to ensure the same level of accuracy because \\nis cluster sampling procedural potential for order bias and other sources of error is \\nusually accentuated. The clustering approach can, however, make the sampling \\nprocedure relatively easier and increase the efficiency of field work, specially in \\nthe case of personal interviews. Area sampling is quite close to cluster sampling \\nand is often talked about when the total geographical area of interest happens to be \\nbig one. Under area sampling we first divide the total area into a number of smaller \\nnon-overlapping areas, generally called geographical clusters, then a number of \\nthese smaller areas are randomly selected, and all units in these small areas are \\nincluded in the sample. Area sampling is specially helpful where we do not have'),\n",

In the process of analysis, relationships or differences supporting or \\nconflicting with original or new hypotheses should be subjected to tests of \\nsignificance to determine with what validity data can be said to indicate any \\nconclusion(s).For instance, if there are two samples of weekly wages, each sample \\nbeing drawn from factories indifferent parts of the same city, giving two different \\nmean values, then our problem may be whether the two mean values are \\nsignificantly different or the difference is just a matter of chance.\\nThrough the use of statistical tests we can establish whether such a difference is a \\nreal one or is the result of random fluctuations. If the difference happens to be real, \\nthe inference will be that the two samples Research come from different universes \\nand if the difference is due to chance, the conclusion would be that the two \\nsamples belong to the same universe. Similarly, the technique of analysis of \\nvariance can help us in analyzing whether three or more varieties of seeds grown \\non certain fields yield significantly different results or not. In brief, the researcher \\ncan analyze the collected data with the help of various statistical measures.\\n9. Hypothesis-testing: After analyzing the data as stated above, the researcher is \\nin a position to test the hypotheses, if any, he had formulated earlier. Do the facts \\nsupport the hypotheses or they happen to be contrary? This is the usual question \\nwhich should be answered while testing hypotheses .Various tests, such as Chi'),\n",

It is a scholarly and systematic search for relevant knowledge on \\na specified subject. The Oxford Learner’s Dictionaries defines “Research” as “A careful study of a subject, especially to discover \\nnew facts or information about it”. Research is a philosophy of systematic study that critically investigates several aspects of \\nprofessional work, including development of prominent concepts that manage a particular process, and development and analyse \\nnovel theories. In accordance with Woody (1927), research includes identifying research problem, creating hypotheses, collecting, \\nanalysing, and assessing data and making inference. As a result, research is a distinctive contribution that advances the current \\nknowledge via investigation, observation, comparison, and experimentation. To put it in a nutshell, research is the pursuit of \\nknowledge through a methodical approach to problem-solving. \\nKEYWORDS: Quantitative Research, Research Methodology, Quantitative \\n \\nINTRODUCTION \\nIt is an essential question to know What motivates people to conduct research? According to Kothari (2004), the following reasons \\nmight encourage people to do research however they are not a complete list of the variables that motivate people to participate \\nin research projects. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nTo obtain a research degree, as well as the benefits that come with it \\n\\uf0b7 \\nTo deal with the challenges the unsolved problems, i.e., apprehension about real-world problems originates research \\n\\uf0b7 \\nTo experience the intellectual pleasure of completing some creative task \\n\\uf0b7 \\nTo offer a service to society \\n\\uf0b7 \\nTo get respectability \\nThe three common approaches for conducting research are a qualitative method, quantitative method, and mixed methods. \\nQualitative research involves the quality of data and aims to understand the explanations and motives for actions, and also the \\nway individuals perceive their experiences and the world around them. Qualitative research creates perceptions into a problem\\'s \\ncontext and provides ideas and hypotheses. Quantitative research seeks to establish a knowledge and understanding of numerous \\nassumptions that have been developed in a study. Thus, during the planning and designing phases, it involves a cycle of \\nconsecutive phases of hypothesis formation and creativity, discipline, and patience.  \\nQuantitative research involves quantifying things and asks questions such as \"how long,\" \"how many,\" and \"the degree to which.\" \\nQuantitative research aims to quantify the data and generalize findings from a sample of a study from varied perspectives. It \\nrequires collecting data, analyzing, and interpreting quantifiable data to prove the hypothesis produced in a specific study. \\nQuantitative research relies on data collection and data analysis which is based on a logical method with the focus on testing \\ntheory, influenced by empiricist and positivist ideologies (Bryman, 2016). Quantitative research describes the specific qualities \\nand rather important differences to generate conclusions in research. Therefore quantitative research creates more consideration \\nabout the problem. The key features of quantitative research are as follows:  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nCollecting data by utilizing standardized research instruments. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nFindings are based on larger sample sizes. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nReporting the research because of high reliability. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nResponding to research questions and meeting the research objectives. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nPlanning all research phases before data collection.'),\n",

Characteristics of Quantitative Research \\nQuantitative or qualitative research is being chosen based on the type of the topic, research questions, and research problem. \\nThen the selected method determines the exact research design and procedures such as the sample of the research, data \\ncollection instruments, data analysis, and final result interpretation. According to Creswell (2002)the major characteristics of \\nquantitative research are: \\n\\uf0b7 \\nDescribing a problem statement by presenting the need for an explanation of a variable's relationship. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nOffering literature, a significant function by answering research questions, explaining the research challenges, and generating \\na demand for the research direction \\n\\uf0b7 \\nCreating precise, quantifiable, observable purpose statements, research questions, and hypotheses \\n\\uf0b7 \\nCollecting numerical data from a sample of the study by using instruments \\n\\uf0b7 \\nUsing statistical analysis for analyzing patterns, comparing groups, or connecting variables, then finding interpretation by \\ncomparing them to previous research and predictions \\n\\uf0b7 \\nProviding the unbiased study report by utilizing standard frameworks and assessment standards, while remaining impartial \\nand unbiased \\nThe researcher in quantitative research selects a study problem based on patterns to clarify the reason something happens. \\nExplaining a trend indicates that the research problem may be addressed when the researcher attempts to identify common \\ntendency of responses from people and to observe the differentiation of tendency between individuals. \\nIn quantitative research, findings can inform how a big population perceives a problem, as well as the diversity of those \\nperspectives. Some quantitative research problems, on the other hand, demand the researcher to describe how one variable \\nimpacts another variable. Variables are characteristics of people or attributes that researchers investigate. The quantitative \\nresearcher is interested in discovering the influence of one variable on another variable. Generally, the literature review has a \\nsignificant role in quantitative research by explaining the necessity for the research problem and providing prospective study goals \\nand research questions. \\nJustifying the research problem entails using the literature to demonstrate the significance of the topic under consideration. So, \\nquantitative researchers are supposed to search the literature to discover some research to identify the investigated topic and \\nthen reference these literatures in the introductory parts of a report. \\nTo acquire measurable and observable data about variables, quantitative researchers should ask particular and restricted \\nquestions to identify a few variables. A tool to measure, monitor, record quantitative data that includes particular options for \\nquestions and answers that the researcher designed is an instrument. The survey, standardized exams, and checklists are examples \\nof research instruments that researchers could use for conducting research and collecting data in the format of numbers. \\nIn quantitative data analysis, the researcher uses mathematical techniques known as statistics to analyze the data. These analyses \\nentail segmenting the data for answering the research questions. Using statistical techniques, like groups comparison, offer data \\nto help answer hypotheses and also research questions. The research findings must be interpreted. The researcher should \\ninterpret the analysis to explain not only the research finding but also in what way the result support or reject the study's \\nanticipated predictions. \\n2. Objectives of Quantitative Research \\nThe research goal is finding responses to problems and questions via using scientific techniques. However, each research project \\nhas its particular aim. Kothari (2004) classifies research objectives into the following general categories: \\n\\uf0b7 \\nExploratory or Formulative Research: To become acquainted with a phenomenon or to acquire novel insights about it \\n\\uf0b7 \\nDescriptive Research: To correctly depict the qualities of a certain individual, group, or situation \\nQuantitative research is classified into four types: \\n1.

The purpose of experimental research is to discover a corelation and relationship between the dependent variable \\nand independent variable. Data in an experimental study must be quantifiable or measured. It is also known as intervention \\nresearch or group comparison research. It is a technique used in quantitative research to assess if an activity or materials affect \\nparticipant outcomes. The researcher measures the effect by assigning a single set of actions to one group, which is called \\nintervention, and denying the set of actions to the other group. \\nDeveloping a set of methods to test a hypothesis means experimental design. A successful experimental design necessitates a \\nthorough grasp of the system under study. The first step will be started with considering the variables and their relations. In the \\nsecond step, the researcher will make explicit and testable predictions. Third step will demonstrate not only the level of details \\nbut also the external validity of findings base on how precisely the researcher modifies independent variables. In the fourth step, \\nthe internal validity of the experiment will be determined by the researcher\\'s decisions on randomization, experimental controls, \\nas well as between vs. within-subjects designs. \\n2.2. \\nCorrelational Designs \\nThe purpose of correlational research is to identify variables that have a connection in a way that a change in one affects a change \\nin the other. In this type of design researcher examine two variables to demonstrate if there is a statistically \\nconsiderable relationship between them without manipulating them, for example, the relationship between diet and anxiety. \\nUnlike experimental research, which is fully based on scientific technique and hypothesis, this sort of study is descriptive. There \\nare three forms of correlational study as: \\n\\uf0b7 \\nPositive correlational research \\n\\uf0b7 \\nNegative correlational research \\n\\uf0b7 \\nNo correlational research  \\nThe direction of a correlation can be either positive or negative. \\n2.3. \\nDescriptive Research \\nIn nature, descriptive research could be either quantitative or qualitative. This kind of research involves quantitative data that can \\nbe collated in numerical form, like test scores or the amount of times an individual use a specific feature of a multimedia program, \\nor it can explain categories of data, like gender or patterns of communication while using technology in a group setting. \\nAccording to Hopkins and Weeks (1990) quantitative research describes the specific qualities and rather important differences to \\ngenerate conclusions in research. Therefore quantitative research creates more consideration about the problem. Descriptive \\nresearch aims to accurately describe a population, situation, and phenomenon and the characteristics which are more concerned \\nwith “what, where, and when” rather than “why” something has happened. Because before researching why something happens, \\nthere is a need to understand how, when, and where it happens.  \\nAccording to Gall and Borg (1989) descriptive studies are intended to discover \"what is\". Therefore, for collecting descriptive data, \\nobservational and survey methods are frequently being used. It frequently uses visual aids like either graphs or charts to assist the \\naudience in comprehending the data distribution. The reason is that the human brain is incapable of extracting a large quantity of \\noriginal data so descriptive statistics data is reducing to digestible and manageable format. In contrast to experimental research, \\nthe researcher does observation and measurement and does not manipulate the variables. \\nThe best technique for discovering characteristics, frequencies, trends, and categories is descriptive research. For having a valid \\nand reliable result it is essential to have a developed research design. Descriptive research can be carried out using particular data \\ncollection methods and it provides a comprehensive understanding of a research problem. The advantage of the descriptive \\nmethod is that it allows the study to be performed in the respondent’s natural context that not only certifies high-quality data but \\nalso represents data collection from a large population. The three main types of descriptive research are: \\n\\uf0b7 \\nSurvey \\n\\uf0b7 \\nCase study \\n\\uf0b7 \\nObservation. \\n2.3.1. \\nCase Study \\nThis kind of research includes a detailed analysis of a person or group of people. Case studies can lead the researcher not only to \\ntest hypotheses but also investigate unusual phenomena.

The confirmation from multiple-case studies is stronger and more trustworthy \\nthan confirmation from single-case studies because it demonstrate a more in-depth examination of research questions and the \\ndevelopment of theories (Stake, 2013).  \\n2.3.2. \\nObservation \\nAll research includes some form of observation, which might be quantitative or qualitative. A quantitative observation requires \\ndata collection in numerical form and should be interpreted in terms of a number. In quantitative observations, statistical survey \\ndata is being used for analysing. Researchers observe participants in a naturalistic environment from a distance. Because the \\nsample of the study is in the natural environment, the observed characteristics are enriching and provide additional information. \\nAdditionally, it produces more ecological validity than in comparison to laboratory observation. The extent to which research may \\nbe used in real-world circumstances is referred to as ecological validity. Before developing testable hypotheses, models, or \\ntheories, the researcher needs to observe and describe the subject under study systematically. \\n2.3.3. \\nSurvey  \\nSurvey research is a quantitative approach in which the researcher distributes a series of questions to a sample of research. It is \\nespecially beneficial when a researcher wants to describe the characteristics, attitudes, behaviors, and opinions of a large \\npopulation. The analysis phase interoperates statistical data to conclude proving or disproving hypotheses. Respondents reply \\nthrough questionnaires, surveys, or polls in survey research. Research to collect precise and effective data should have the proper \\nsurvey questions with open-ended and close ended-questions. The survey method can be used either online or offline with \\nenormous sample size. In a survey, a sample is a subsection of people chosen from a population. Therefore, the researcher studies \\nthe sample then searches to communalize the results to the population. One of the advantages of using a survey is that the \\nresearcher can collect data from a sample of respondents from a large population. Analysis of large datasets properly represent \\nthe population's diversity and rather data collection can be generalized to the larger population with more reliability than the data \\ncollected through a case study.  The two forms of survey that can be used based on the time and the type of data are: \\n\\uf0b7 \\nCross-sectional survey \\n\\uf0b7 \\nLongitudinal survey \\n2.3.3.1. \\nCross-sectional Survey \\nThese kinds of surveys are observational surveys that apply when the researcher plans to collect data from a sample of the target \\ngroup at a specific time. A quantitative researcher can assess several variables at a specific time. In a cross-sectional survey data \\ncollection is from individuals who show similarity in all variables except those chosen for study. Multiple samples can be analyzed \\nand compared by conducting a cross-sectional survey. Longitudinal surveys are the inverse of cross-sectional studies. In cross-\\nsectional studies data collection will be from many subjects at once, on the other hand, in longitudinal studies data collection will \\nbe continued from the same subjects throughout time, generally concentrating on a smaller group of individuals with similar \\nfeature. \\n2.3.3.2. \\nLongitudinal surveys \\nLongitudinal surveys are called observational surveys in which researchers evaluate the same individuals continue to discover any \\nchanges that may occur over time. This kind of survey is substantially used not only in the area of medicine and applied sciences \\nbut also in the market trend for analyzing customer satisfaction or gathering feedback on products or services. Longitudinal studies \\nare a type of correlational research. In this kind of study, the researcher observes and collects data on several variables without \\ntrying to influence them which can be found in the economy, social or medical sciences. Figure 2 shows the differences between \\nthese two types of surveys. \\n2.4. \\nCausal-Comparative/Quasi-Experimental Research \\nThis kind of research attempts to identify cause-and-effect relationships between the variables which are extremely similar to \\nactual experiments but with few important distinctions. Therefore an independent variable is discovered but not modified, and \\nthe independent variable's effects on the dependent variable are being assessed. The groups are not being assigned randomly; \\nthe researcher needs to use naturally formed or pre-existing groups. The control groups will expose to the treatment variable then \\nwill be studied and compared. After analysing and making conclusions, determining causes must be done carefully, because known \\nand unknown variables can affect the results. \\n3. Problem Statement \\nA research problem refers to a definite and concise statement concerning a source of problems that need to be remedied, \\nchallenges that need to be eliminated, or questions that exist in scholarly literature, theory, or existing practice and indicates the \\nneed for clear comprehension and purposive investigation (Bryman, 2007).

In quantitative research, a research problem needs to measure variables, determine the effect of these variables on \\na result, examine theories, and apply the findings to a large population. After identifying the research problem, the researcher \\nneeds to write problem statement part comprises (Creswell, 2002): \\n\\uf0b7 \\nResearch topic \\n\\uf0b7 \\nResearch problem \\n\\uf0b7 \\nResearch problem authenticity as discovered in the previous studies should be justified \\n\\uf0b7 \\nResearch gap in current knowledge concerning the research problem \\n\\uf0b7 \\nResearch audiences who will advantage from a research problem \\nThe researcher can simply comprehend introductions to research projects by identifying these five aspects. \\n4. Research Objectives \\nIn any research project, a crucial task is to define the core objectives. In quantitative research, a research objective defines the \\naims and goals that the researcher intends to attain and it is the result of the research project after its implementation. It should \\nbe closely related to the problem statement and provide direction to the performance of the research. Before developing research \\nobjectives, the researcher should be updated in the research area and identify the knowledge gaps that need to be filled. \\nThe focus of the quantitative research objective is concise, narrow, and measurable. The quantitative researcher needs to have a \\ndistinctly defined research question where answers are sought. The methodology of quantitative research should describe how \\neach objective will be achieved. The research objectives should be directly connected to the problem statement, resulting in clear \\nand attainable objectives. Research objectives act as a guide to determine suitable research design, problem statement, data \\ncollection procedure, analyze and interpret data and variables of the study. Therefore the research objectives need to be specific, \\nmeasurable, achievable, realistic, and time-constrained. When the researcher can explain in simple terms what the research is \\nabout and why it matters, it shows the aims and objectives are concise and clear. There are some differences between the aims \\nand the objectives of the research as: \\n\\uf0b7 \\nSims of research describe what the researcher hopes to achieve, on the other hand, the objectives detail how the researcher \\nintends to achieve aims. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nSims of the research are relatively broad; on the other hand, the objectives are specific. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nAims of a research focus on a project’s long-term results; on the other hand, objectives focus on immediate and short-term \\noutcomes. \\nThe aim of the research is being followed by a series of statements explaining the research objectives, which indicate the \\nresearch topic and problems in details. \\n5. Purpose Statement  \\nA purpose statement states the research's purpose, scope, and direction that directly addresses the problem and closes the stated \\ngap. It notifies the reader what to anticipate from the study and what the precise focus will be. The researcher needs to write the \\npurpose statement in a single phrase and start it with keywords like “The purpose of the study …”. In this phase, the researcher \\nshould state how the theory will be tested. In the purpose statement, the words relate, compare, or describe should be used to \\nshow the relationship between variables. The researcher should specify not only the independent and dependent variables but \\nalso a sample and participants. Research objectives and purpose are being created by problem statement and the research gap. \\nThe purpose statements need to be clear and concise, flow from the problem statement and address the proposed problem, \\nmatch the methodology, and answer the question ‘Why the researcher is doing this research?’ \\n6. Theoretical and Conceptual Framework \\nQuantitative researchers examine if the independent variable affects on the dependent variable because previous researchers \\nindicate that this relationship exists. Some researchers discovered a theory that predicts how the dependent variable would be \\naffected by an independent variable. The concept of probable causation states that rather than proving the relationship, \\nresearchers seek to demonstrate a cause-and-effect relationship between variables. In quantitative research, a theory predicts \\nand describes the possible relationship between dependent variables and independent variables. For instance, the researchers \\ninvestigate the relationship and effect of peer groups on teenagers. This connection is put to the test regularly basis, such as with \\nreligious organizations, middle schools, or high schools. Constantly the connection of a constructive and beneficial impact has \\nbeen proven true. Eventually an individual labels this relationship and connection as a theory and determines a name (Creswell, \\n2002).\"),\n",

The researcher is supposed to obtain data from different \\nresources and sorts them under main theories. The foundation of the research problem is the conceptual framework which \\nderived from the theoretical framework and regularly emphasizes the foundation of the study. While the theoretical framework \\nincludes theories or problems wherein the research is linked, the conceptual framework defines the components of the theoretical \\nframework that the researcher chose to serve as the foundation of investigation. Consequently, the conceptual framework \\ndevelops from the theoretical framework and is linked to the particular problem statement (Kumar, 2018). \\n7. Research Questions \\nAs the name suggests, research questions are frequently grounded in research. Quantitative research questions are clear and \\ninclude the sample of the study, dependent and independent variables, and the research design. They are typically completed at \\nthe beginning of the research (Berger, 2015). Research questions narrow the purpose statement to precise questions which need \\nto pursue to find a response. The research question should begin with “how”, “what”, and “why”. For demonstrating the type of \\nthe variables, the researcher needs to use words like describe, compare, relate. Quantitative research has three methods of \\nresearch question:  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nDescriptive questions \\n\\uf0b7 \\nRelationship questions \\n\\uf0b7 \\nComparison questions \\n7.1. \\nDescriptive Questions \\nThis type of question is using by the researcher to find out the answers of the samples of the study to a particular question. \\nDescriptive questions typically begin with “what.” \\n7.2. \\nRelationship Questions \\nA relationship question is used by the researcher to identify the relationship between two or multiple variables.  \\n7.3. \\nComparison Questions \\nComparison question helps to discover what differences exist between two or more groups of an independent variable in terms \\nof one or more result variables. \\n8. Quantitative Hypotheses  \\nOne of the most essential phases in designing quantitative research is defining the research hypothesis. In quantitative research, \\nhypotheses are specific, clear, and testable statements in which the researcher state a priori expectation about the result of \\nresearch for example predicting the relationship between variables.  A hypothesis is more than only a random guess; it should be \\nfounded on current theories, information, and knowledge. A hypothesis needs to be testable, which implies that the researcher \\nmust be able to support or disprove it by using scientific procedures such as tests, observations, experiments, and statistical data \\nanalysis. \\nIn quantitative research, hypotheses restrict the purpose statement and offer a researcher’s prediction about expected findings \\n(Creswell, 2002). The variables should be stated in the following order:  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nFirst position; Independent variable \\n\\uf0b7 \\nSecond position: Dependent variable \\n\\uf0b7 \\nThird position: Control variable \\nHypotheses are classified into two types: \\n\\uf0b7 \\nNull hypotheses \\n\\uf0b7 \\nAlternative to null hypotheses \\n8.1. \\nNull Hypothesis \\nThe null hypothesis predicts that there is no relationship between the independent and dependent variable. For instance, “There \\nis no difference between” groups or “There is no relationship between (or among)” variables might be used to tart a null \\nhypothesis. \\n8.2. \\nAlternative Hypotheses \\nIf the null hypothesis is rejected, the alternative hypothesis is true as it suggests a relationship or a modification based on findings \\nfrom previous studies, or a description or theory described in the literature.'),\n",

Literature Review \\nThe literature review is the backbone of all types of research which includes a comprehensive summary of previous research on a \\ntopic. It should be enumerated, described, summarised, objectively evaluated, and clarified. Writing a quantitative literature \\nreview contains critically analyzing relevant research and publications. It needs to be started by searching for relevant literature, \\nthen evaluating the resources. After finding the gap, the researcher should outline the structure and finally write a literature \\nreview. By conducting a literature review the researcher demonstrates how the research adds to the current body of knowledge. \\nAt the beginning of a quantitative study, researchers discuss the literature to justify and emphasize the significance of the problem \\nand give the rationale for the study\\'s goal, hypotheses, or research questions. The literature needs to be used at the end of the \\nresearch for confirming, disconfirming, contrasting, and comparing with past research results. According to Kumar (2018) the \\nliterature review can the researcher in four ways: \\n1. Make the research problem clearer and more focused \\n2. Develop the research methodology \\n3. Expand the knowledge base in the field of study \\n4. Contextualize the results \\n10. Research Designs \\nThe particular processes involved in the research process are known as research designs. The research design serves as the \\n“blueprint” for the research investigation. These procedures include collecting data, analyzing data, and writing reports. Saunders \\nresearch onions provide a comprehensive explanation of the steps of a research procedure. It demonstrates an efficient procedure \\nfor developing a research methodology. Saunders, Lewis, and Thornhill (2007) view the research process as the unwrapping of an \\nonion layer by layer. The outer layers need to be unwrapped to view the inner layer. Accordingly for achieving objectives, the right \\nsteps have to be taken, it applies that the first step needs to be covered before proceeding to another step. \\nThe researcher needs to know the significance and application of variables in order to develop purpose statements, research \\nquestions, and also hypotheses. In statistics and research, variables are items that the researcher can measure, observe, \\nmanipulate, and control. The value of a variable might vary either between groups or over time. For instance, if an individual\\'s eye \\ncolor is the variable in an experiment, its value can vary from brown to blue to green from person to person. \\nThe term variable has a root that is linked to the word \"vary,\" which should help to grasp what variables are. Variables are objects, \\nthings, or factors that have the ability to change, like the temperature, weight, and mood of a person. Variables might have varying \\nvalues depending on the circumstances or for different persons. The major kinds of quantitative research are: \\n\\uf0b7 \\nIndependent variables \\n\\uf0b7 \\nDependent variables \\n\\uf0b7 \\nSample variables. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nExtraneous variables \\n10.1. \\nIndependent Variable (IV) \\nAn independent variable has a unique feature that cannot be changed by the other variables. For example, age is an example of \\nan independent variable because the living place, the foods they eat will not affect their age. Independent variable has the \\npotential to affect other variables. In a cause and effect question, independent variables are the variable that causes the effect. \\n10.2. \\nDependent Variable (DV) \\nThe dependent variables are impacted by the independent variables as they are the outcome of the impact of the independent \\nvariables, so it is a variable that receives the intervention. For example, a grade on an exam is a dependent variable as it depends \\non factors such as how long you studied. Because studying time affects test score on the other hand test score does not affect \\ntest score. \\n10.3. \\nQuantitative Variable \\nA quantitative variable represents a measure and it is numerical like height, distance, or number of items. Quantitative variables \\nare divided into two types: \\n\\uf0b7 \\nDiscrete variable \\n\\uf0b7 \\nContinuous variable \\n10.3.1. \\nQuantitative Discrete Variable \\nA quantitative discrete variable is any numerical variable that can be counted, as a number of children per family or the number \\nof teachers in a school. It cannot be broken into fractions and decimals. For example, you cannot buy half a ticket. \\n10.3.2. \\nQuantitative Continuous Variables \\nQuantitative continuous variables is numerical variables that cannot finish counting, like time, temperature, weight. It can be \\nbroken down into fractions and decimals.'),\n",

Reliability and Validity of Instruments  \\nThe conceptualization of reliability and validity employed to assess the research's quality shows the accuracy of a methodology in \\nmeasuring something.  Reliability is about the consistency of a measure, and validity is about the accuracy of a measure. While \\nthe researcher develops a research design, planning methodology, and outlining the findings, it is critical to consider reliability \\nand validity. \\nReliability refers to a method which consistency measures something. If consistently the same findings are achieved by utilising \\nthe same method, the measurement is reliable. \\nValidity refers to a method which precisely measures something. A high validity research provides findings that correlate to \\ngenuine features and variances in either the physical or social reality. High reliability represents a measurement is valid or not and \\nif a method is not reliable, it probably is not valid. \\n11.1. \\nAssessing the Reliability and Validity  \\nReliability can be determine by comparing several versions of the same measurement. It is more difficult to assess the validity but \\nit can be determine by comparing the findings to other accurate theory and data.  \\n11.2. \\nTypes of Reliability \\nReliability refers to the consistency of a measure which includes three main types: \\n\\uf0b7 \\nTest-retest evaluates the consistency of a measure over time \\n\\uf0b7 \\nInterrater evaluates the consistency of a measure among observers \\n\\uf0b7 \\nInternal consistency evaluates the consistency of the measurement \\n11.3. \\nTypes of Validity \\nValidity is described as the degree that a concept is precisely measured and evaluated in quantitative research which includes \\nthree main kinds of validity as: \\n\\uf0b7 \\nConstruct: The conformity of a measure to established theory and knowledge of the concept being evaluated. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nContent: The extent to which the measurement encompasses all features of the concept being measured. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nCriterion: The extent to which a measure's outcome conforms to other valid measurements with the same concept. \\n12. Sampling Design \\nThe method of selecting the sample size has a major impact on the accuracy of findings. The goal of sampling in quantitative \\nresearch is to make conclusions about the group the researcher collect a sample in an unbiased way through randomization which \\nrepresents the population from where it is selected (Kumar, 2018). \\nA quantitative researcher is led by a predefined sample size depending on available resources, research style, and the possible \\nuse of the results. The large sample size is highly valued in research that aiming to create policies, to assess the relationship, or to \\nestablish impact evaluations because a larger sample size encompassing different backgrounds and ensuring that the sample is \\ndemonstrating the research population. According to Kumar (2018), the sampling design can be categorised as: \\n\\uf0b7 \\nRandom/probability sampling designs \\n\\uf0b7 \\nNon-random/non-probability sampling designs \\n\\uf0b7 \\nSystematic/mixed sampling design \\nEvery component in the population needs to have an equivalent and independent probability of being selected in the sample in \\nrandom sampling or probability sampling designs. The most common methods for selecting a random sample are (Kumar, 2018): \\n\\uf0b7 \\nFishbowl draw \\n\\uf0b7 \\nComputer program \\n\\uf0b7 \\nTable of randomly generated numbers \\nNon-random or non-probability sampling designs is employed when the number of components in a population is unknown or \\ncannot be exclusively recognised. The most common methods for selecting a non-random sample are (Kumar, 2018): \\n\\uf0b7 \\nQuota sampling \\n\\uf0b7 \\nAccidental sampling \\n\\uf0b7 \\nJudgemental sampling or purposive sampling \\n\\uf0b7 \\nExpert sampling \\n\\uf0b7 \\nSnowball sampling \\nSystematic/mixed sampling design has the features of random and non-random sampling designs. In this type of design, the \\nsampling frame needs to be distributed into segments called intervals. Then, the SRS approach is used to choose one element \\nfrom the first interval. The arrangement of the element selected in the initial interval determines which subsequent elements are\"),\n",

Data Collection  \\n“Research tool” or “Research instrument” is a means of collecting data in research, like questionnaires, interviews, and \\nobservation. The quantitative process of data collection includes: \\n\\uf0b7 \\nDefining the participants or sample of research \\n\\uf0b7 \\nGetting authorizations from organizations or individuals  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nDetermining what type of data to collect  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nSelecting research instruments \\n\\uf0b7 \\nDirecting the data collection procedure  \\n14. Select a Statistical Program \\nQuantitative researchers typically utilise statistical programmes that are accessible as laptop or desktop software or on university \\ncomputers. It is suggested to search for a programme that has the statistics that are suitable to answer research questions and \\nresearch hypotheses. A lot of websites provide extensive information on the several statistical analysis computer applications that \\nare available.  \\n15. Data Analysis \\nIn the process of analyzing quantitative data, multiple interconnected processes are employed.   \\nThe first stage is organizing the data for analysis. It includes choosing in what way give numerical scores to the data, evaluating \\nthe categories of scores, taking statistical software, and entering the data into the computer. \\nThe second stage is analyzing the data.  Typically, a descriptive analysis of the data reports the measurements of central tendency \\nand also variance. Subsequently, more complicated inferential analysis is performed to test the hypotheses and evaluate \\nconfidence intervals and effect sizes. \\nThe third stage is reporting the research outcome not only through tables, figures but also through discussing, summarizing, and \\ncomparing the results with previous theories and literatures. It should be ended with the limitation of the research and \\nrecommendation for future research. After preparing and organizing the data, the data needs to be analyzed to address all \\nquestions and hypotheses of the study (Creswell, 2002). \\n15.1. \\nDescriptive Statistic \\nA descriptive statistic is utilized in research to investigate the essential characteristics of the data by summarizing the samples and \\nmeasurements. Descriptive statistics are used to convert complicated quantitative information into bite-sized explanations. It \\nallows the researcher to present the data and interpretation in a comprehensible and meaningful way. Descriptive statistics \\ninclude (figure 6): \\n\\uf0b7 \\nDistribution refers to the frequency of each value. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nCentral tendency refers to the averages of the values (mean, median, and mode) \\n\\uf0b7 \\nVariability (spread) refers to how spread out the values are (standard deviation, variance, minimum and maximum variables, \\nkurtosis, and skewness) \\n15.2. \\nInferential Statistics \\nIn inferential statistics, the researcher collects the data from a sample of the study and make a prediction that affects the results \\non a large population. The researcher uses inferential statistics to achieve results that are beyond the immediate data. Although \\ndescriptive statistics can just describe the characteristics of a sample, on the other hand, inferential statistics utilize a sample to \\nmake accurate estimates about the wider population. When using inferential statistics, it is necessary to employ random and \\nunbiased sampling procedures. If the sample does not represent the population, then having valid statistical inferences is not \\npossible. \\n16.

Reporting research entails selecting an audience, organizing the report in a compatible arrangement with \\ntarget audiences, and subsequently preparing the report. For each audience, the arrangement of the research report will differ, \\nranging from a formal and official arrangement for writing project paper and dissertations to a casual arrangement for writing \\nschool reports (Creswell, 2002). Researchers have to be courteous in all sorts of reports and avoid using terminology that \\ndistinguishes sexual preference, gender, ethnicity, and racial background. The audiences will also have their criteria for assessing \\nand evaluating the value of the study. Assessing research is analyzing the value and quality of research through of \\nstandard educational criteria that are proposed by individuals. According to McNabb (2017) the researcher is supposed to report \\nall following steps while reporting the findings of quantitative research: \\n\\uf0b7 \\nData collection, statistics, and relevant finding to problem statement needs to be explained. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nUnexpected incidents during data collection needs to be reported. The researcher is supposed to clarify why missing data \\ndoes not undermine the validity of the analysis. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nA rationale for using statistical procedure needs to be provided. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nWhen a researcher use inferential statistics, provide the descriptive statistics, confidence intervals, and sample sizes for each \\nvariable as well as the value of the test statistic, its direction, the degrees of freedom, and the significance level. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nUsing tables provide exact values and utilising figures convey global effects. the reader needs to be concise what to look for \\nin tables and figures. The researcher encouraged to use graphic representations of confidence intervals. \\nThe researcher is supposed to ending the research by giving a summary of the topic and providing a final comment and evaluation \\nof the research. The summary of findings, recommendations, and future research needs to be included (Nenty, 2009). \\n \\nCONCLUSION \\nIn the study of Hall, Ward, and Comer (1988), a team of judges assess 128 educational quantitative papers and concludes that the \\nresearcher needs to consider rigorous reliability and validity in data collection techniques, strengths in research designs, \\nappropriate research design for the problem, reasonable sampling, clearly report the findings of analysis, appropriate methods to \\nanalyze data, clear writing, clearly stated assumptions, and clear data collection methods to have a quality quantitative research. \\n \\nREFERENCES \\n1) Berger, R.

Since this \\ncourse is not taught before the Master’s degree, the students are not \\nfamiliar with its vocabulary, methodology and course contents. \\n \\nThe authors have made an attempt to write it in very non-\\ntechnical language. It has been attempted that students who try to \\nunderstand the research methodology through self-learning may also \\nfind it easy. The chapters are written with that approach. Even those \\nstudents who intend to attain high level of knowledge of the research \\nmethodology in social sciences will find this book very helpful in \\nunderstanding the basic concepts before they read any book on \\nresearch methodology. \\n \\nThis book is useful those students who offer the Research \\nMethodology at Post Graduation and M.Phil. Level. This book is also \\nvery useful for Ph.D. Course Work examinations.  \\n \\n                                                                   Dr. Prabhat Pandey \\n                                                                   Dr. Meenu Mishra Pandey'),\n",

Without systematic research there would have been very little \\nprogress. \\n \\nJohn W. Best has rightly said, “The secret of our cultural \\ndevelopment has been research, pushing back the areas of ignorance by \\ndiscovering new truths, which, in turn, lead to better ways of doing \\nthings and better products.” \\n \\nScientific research leads to progress in some field of life. New \\nproducts, new facts, new concepts and new ways of doing things are \\nbeing found due to ever-increasing significant research in the physical, \\nthe biological, the social and the psychological fields. Research today is \\nno longer confined to the science laboratory. \\n \\nMeaning of Research: \\nWord ‘Research’ is comprises of two words = Re+Search. It means to \\nsearch again. So research means a systematic investigation or activity to \\ngain new knowledge of the already existing facts. \\n \\nResearch is an intellectual activity. It is responsible for bringing \\nto light new knowledge. It is also responsible for correcting the present \\nmistakes, removing existing misconceptions and adding new learning to \\nthe existing fund of knowledge. Researches are considered as a \\ncombination of those activities which are removed from day to day life \\n1'),\n",

But it is not correct to say that the research is \\nrestricted to such type of persons, however, it is correct to say that \\nmajor contribution of research comes from highly gifted and committed \\nworkers. Thus the research is not at all mysterious and is carried on by \\nhundreds of thousands of average individuals. \\n \\nResearch is also considered as the application of scientific \\nmethod in solving the problems. It is a systematic, formal and intensive \\nprocess of carrying on the scientific method of analysis. There are many \\nways of obtaining knowledge. They are intuition, revelation, and \\nauthority, logical manipulation of basic assumptions, informed guesses, \\nobservation, and reasoning by analogy. One of the branches of research \\nknown as empirical research is highly goal-oriented technique. \\n \\nDefinitions of Research: \\nThe following are the important definitions of research: \\n“Research is an endeavor / attempt to discover, develop and verify \\nknowledge. It is an intellectual process that has developed over \\nhundreds of years ever changing in purpose and form and always \\nresearching to truth.”                                  \\n                                                                                                 J. Francis Rummel \\n“Research is an honest, exhaustive, intelligent searching for facts and \\ntheir meanings or implications with reference to a given problem. The \\nproduct or findings of a given piece of research should be an authentic, \\nverifiable contribution to knowledge in the field studied.”               \\n                   P.M. Cook                                                          \\n“Research may be defined as a method of studying problems whose \\nsolutions are to be derived partly or wholly from facts.”       \\n                          W.S.

A good research design possesses the following \\ncharacteristics; \\n \\n(i) Objectivity: \\nIt refers to the findings related to the method of data collection and \\nscoring of the responses. The research design should permit the \\nmeasuring instruments which are fairly objective in which every \\nobserver or judge scoring the performance must precisely give the same \\nreport. In other words, the objectivity of the procedure may be judged \\nby the degree of agreement between the final scores assigned to \\ndifferent individuals by more than one independent observer.

For \\nexample, if a respondent gives out a response to a particular item, he is \\nexpected to give the same response to that item even if he is asked \\nrepeatedly. If he is changing his response to the same item, the \\nconsistency will be lost. So the researcher should frame the items in a \\nquestionnaire in such a way that it provides consistency or reliability. \\n \\n(iii) Validity:  \\nAny measuring device or instrument is said to be valid when it measures \\nwhat it is expected to measure. For example, an intelligence test \\nconducted for measuring the IQ should measure only the intelligence \\nand nothing else and the questionnaire shall be framed accordingly. \\n \\n(iv) Generalizability:  \\nIt means how best the data collected from the samples can be utilized \\nfor drawing certain generalizations applicable to a large group from \\nwhich sample is drawn. Thus a research design helps an investigator to \\ngeneralize his findings provided he has taken due care in defining the \\npopulation, selecting the sample, deriving appropriate statistical \\nanalysis etc. while preparing the research design. Thus a good research \\ndesign is one which is methodologically prepared and should ensure \\nthat generalization is possible. For ensuring the generalization we \\nshould confirm that our research problem has the following \\ncharacteristics; \\na) The problem is clearly formulated. \\nb) The population is clearly defined. \\nc) Most appropriate techniques of sample selection are used to \\nform an appropriate sample. \\nd) Appropriate statistical analysis has been carried out.'),\n",

The schedule is presented by the interviewer. The questions are \\nasked and the answers are noted down by him. \\n2.

History consists of \\nchanges which social structures undergo. Social scientists studies the \\npast to gain a better understanding of the present state of affairs. \\nHistory is the meaningful record of man’s achievement. It is not merely \\na list of characteristics of chronological events, but an integrated \\naccount of the relationship between persons, events, times and places. \\n \\nJohn W. Best, “Man uses history to understand the past, and try \\nto understand the present in the light of past events and \\ndevelopments.” \\n \\nF.N. Kerlinger, “Historical research is the application of the \\nscientific method of inquiry to historical problems.” \\n \\nWhitney, \\n“Historical \\nresearch \\ndeals \\nwith \\nthe \\npast \\nexperiences….its aim is to apply the method of reflective thinking   of \\nsocial problems , still unsolved , by means of discovery  of past trends of \\nevent, fact and attitude. It traces the lines of development in human \\nthought and action in order to reach some basis for social activity.” \\n \\nRedcliff Browne, “Historical  method may be defined as a \\nsystem in which present day events are studied with reference to the \\nevents that took place in the past.” \\n \\nHistorical method seeks to find explanation of questions of \\ncurrent interest by an intensive study of the past. Many studies in the \\nfield of economics, politics, sociology, education and psychology are \\nessentially historical in approach. \\n11'),\n",
